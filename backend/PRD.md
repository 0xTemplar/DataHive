## 1. Overview

Hyvve is evolving into a full-fledged enterprise-grade MLOps and data annotation platform by bridging raw data collection with high-quality, verifiable annotated datasets and immutable provenance. Building on our existing token-incentivized data marketplace, AI Workflow Engine, and the mature `ipfs_datasets_py` toolkit, this PRD outlines new capabilities for real-time collaboration, adaptive AI feedback loops, on-chain incentives, plug-and-play enterprise connectors, and cross-platform extensibility.

## 2. Target Audience

* **Data Requesters (Enterprise ML Teams, AI Companies):** Need turnkey, high-quality labeled datasets with auditable lineage, cloud and on-prem connectors, and SLA-grade observability.
* **Verified Annotators:** Demand seamless batch annotation UIs with real-time collaboration, continuous quality feedback, and instant on-chain token rewards.
* **AI Researchers:** Require reproducible training pipelines with end-to-end provenance, vector search for sample selection, and embedding services.
* **Platform Administrators:** Seek operational visibility into workflow performance, security auditing, and multi-tenant governance.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### 3.1. Product Goals

* Enable **real-time collaborative annotation** with live consensus scoring and conflict resolution.
* Introduce **adaptive LLM-driven feedback loops** to enhance annotation accuracy on the fly.
* Automate **token-based rewards** through on-chain smart contracts for instant incentives.
* Provide **one-click enterprise connectors** to MLOps and data platforms (Hugging Face, S3, GCS, Azure).
* Embed the `ipfs_datasets_py` toolkit for **storage**, **vector embeddings**, **workflow orchestration**, and **security/compliance**.

### 3.2. Business Goals

* Deepen platform stickiness via intelligent, collaborative annotation workflows and cross-system connectors.
* Unlock new revenue streams through premium annotation services, enterprise integrations, and SLA-backed agreements.
* Showcase seamless **IPFS + Filecoin** archival for provable provenance to attract blockchain-centric and regulated customers.

### 3.3. Technical Goals

* Integrate `ipfs_datasets_py`’s `pin_to_ipfs`, `get_from_ipfs`, and provenance tools across all data asset pipelines.
* Build WebSocket-powered collaboration layers on annotation UIs with conflict resolution dashboards.
* Extend our AI Workflow Engine with micro-workflows for LLM-based annotation suggestions and correction passes.
* Deploy minimal smart contracts on Movement chain (or Sui) for automated payout flows.
* Deliver SDKs and connectors for cloud object storage, vector stores (FAISS/Qdrant/Elasticsearch), and external orchestration pipelines.

## 4. Features & Scope

### 4.1. Verifiable Data Annotation Framework

#### 4.1.1. Annotation Campaign Type

* Introduce `campaign_type = ANNOTATION` derived from existing `ProcessedDataset` records.
* Fields: `source_dataset_id`, `annotation_instructions`, `funding_budget`, `batch_size`.

#### 4.1.2. Annotator Verification & Scoring

* Golden-set certification workflow using AI agents: test annotators against pre-labeled samples; update `AnnotatorProfile.is_verified` and record `verification_scores`.

#### 4.1.3. Annotation Task Workflow

* Distribute small batches of data CIDs (IPFS) with hidden honeypot items for ongoing quality checks.
* Trigger AI Workflow: score submissions, update `reputation_score`, compute `reward_amount`; low-confidence flagged for human review.

#### 4.1.4. Real-Time Collaboration & Review

* **Live Sessions:** WebSocket-driven UI where multiple annotators label the same batch; labels merge in real time.
* **Reviewer Dashboard:** Senior annotators or QA teams resolve conflicts, approve final labels, and monitor session metrics.

#### 4.1.5. Adaptive Quality Tuning with LLM Feedback

* **LLM Suggestion Micro-Workflow:** Post-submission, an agent analyzes boundary cases, suggests corrections, and annotators accept or reject improvements.
* **Quality Uplift Metrics:** Capture before/after quality scores; feed metrics back into annotator training modules.

#### 4.1.6. On-Chain Incentive Automation

* **Smart Contract Integration:** Minimal Sui/Movement-chain contract auto-transfers tokens when honeypot pass thresholds are met.
* **Transaction Dashboard:** UI shows annotation → verification → on-chain payout flows with real-time transaction hashes.

#### 4.1.7. Plug-and-Play Enterprise Integrations

* **Cloud Connectors:** One-click exports to Hugging Face Hub, AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob using `ipfs_datasets_py.save_dataset` and format converters.
* **Webhook & SDK Support:** External pipelines listen for post-annotation events; Python/TypeScript SDKs wrap core MCP tool calls (`execute_workflow`, `pin_to_ipfs`).

### 4.2. IPFS & Filecoin Integration for Provenance

#### 4.2.1. Storage & Processing Layer

* **Unified StorageService:** Abstracts Walrus and IPFS via `IPFSStorageTool` (`pin_to_ipfs`, `get_from_ipfs`) for all assets—raw, processed, annotated, and model artifacts.
* **Dataset Toolkit:** Use `load_dataset`, `process_dataset`, `save_dataset` from `ipfs_datasets_py` to power annotation batching, MLOps pipelines, and embedding generation.

#### 4.2.2. Vector & Embedding Services

* **Embedding Generation:** `generate_embedding` to index contributions and annotations for similarity-based task routing.
* **Vector Stores:** Multi-backend connectors (FAISS/Qdrant/Elasticsearch) for enterprise search and retrieval integration.

#### 4.2.3. Provenance & Audit

* **ProvenanceLog:** Leverage `record_provenance` to append immutable audit entries for every transformation and annotation event.
* **FilecoinArchivalTool:** Celery/AI Workflow task submits CIDs to web3.storage/estuary; records `filecoin_deal_id` in `ProvenanceLog`.

#### 4.2.4. Workflow Orchestration

* Centralize background tasks via `execute_workflow` and `schedule_workflow` utilities, replacing bespoke Celery jobs with a unified MCP protocol API.

#### 4.2.5. Security & Compliance

* **Auth & RBAC:** Utilize `authenticate_user`, `check_access_permission`, and rate-limiting from `ipfs_datasets_py` for multi-tenant isolation and per-campaign quotas.
* **Audit Reporting:** Integrate `generate_audit_report` and `security_audit` endpoints into admin UI for compliance reviews.

### 4.3. Enterprise MLOps & Model Training

*(Core MLOps features unchanged; refer to original documentation for full details.)*

### 4.4. Open Knowledge Graph

To unlock semantic discoverability and cross-platform federation, Hyvve will publish its core data as an open knowledge graph on IPFS/IPLD:

* **Graph Ontology Definition:**

  * **Nodes:** Campaign, Contribution, Annotator, AnnotationTask, AnnotationSubmission, ModelArtifact, ProvenanceEvent
  * **Edges:** `contributedBy`, `annotatedBy`, `verifiedBy`, `trainedWith`, `derivedFrom`
  * Definitions published as JSON‑LD or RDF files pinned to IPFS.

* **Graph Construction & Storage:**

  * Extend `record_provenance` to emit RDF triples alongside audit logs.
  * Pin JSON‑LD graph slices to IPFS, producing CIDs for each subgraph.
  * Use IPLD to link content-addressed nodes and edges for immutable graph structure.

* **API & Query Interface:**

  * `GET /kg/node/{cid}` → returns JSON‑LD for that node and its outgoing edges.
  * `POST /kg/query` → accepts SPARQL or GraphQL queries against the IPLD graph stored on IPFS.
  * Leverage vector embeddings for “fuzzy” graph searches (e.g. similarity-based node discovery).

* **Enterprise Federation & SDKs:**

  * SDK helper `fetchKGNode(cid)` in Python/TypeScript to traverse linked nodes.
  * Enterprises can mount IPFS CIDs via standard IPLD protocols into their own GraphDB or data lake.
  * Support for federated queries across multiple IPFS‑hosted graphs.

These capabilities enable:

* **Semantic Discoverability:** Complex queries such as “Which annotators scored above 90% on bounding-box tasks in June 2025?”
* **Machine-Readable Lineage:** Complete traceability from raw contributions to model artifacts.
* **Cross-System Integration:** Any application or system that speaks JSON‑LD or SPARQL can integrate seamlessly with Hyvve’s data.

## 5. System Architecture & Data Model Changes

* **StorageService** now wraps both Walrus and IPFS via `IPFSStorageTool`.
